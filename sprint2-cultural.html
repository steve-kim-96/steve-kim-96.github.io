      <p><strong>Long-term career goal and pathway:</strong><br><br>I don’t have a specific goal in mind in terms of a
        career, but
        one thing I do know is that<br> I want to set up my own shop sometime in the future.<br><br>

        <strong>Human skill I would like to develop at EDA:</strong><br><br>People often describe me as “chill” and
        “laid-back” and I
        accept that description and in<br> a way, I do like it. But I want to be able to captivate an audience, give off
        good first<br> impressions.<br><br>

        <strong>Description of my strength and limitation:</strong><br><br>My biggest strengths are willpower,
        determination, and focus.
        The limitation however,<br> is once I get decent at something, I get bored and because of that I have never<br>
        become truly good at something.
        I want to change that and I think I can do that at EDA.</p>

      <p><strong>How I will manage workload:</strong><br><br>
        Something vital that I have failed to do time and time again is talk to the<br> people responsible for the course or work on how to manage the work effectively.<br> 
        I have the determination and willpower to push through the work, but I will manage<br> myself and work productively with all stakeholders by first learning how.<br><br>
      
        <strong>How and where I will seek help in a timely manner:</strong><br><br>
        During foundations, my go to for help will be facilitators. I can speak to my facilitator<br> Joseph but since he is working remote, if at any point in time I 
        feel like I need<br> face-to-face interaction for assistance I can always ask the facilitators on campus or<br> talk to my seniors.<br><br>
      
        <strong>My expectation from the facilitation team:</strong><br><br>
        Best advice possible.<br><br>
      
      <strong>Scheduling block-out times:</strong><br><br>
    None I can think of.</p>
