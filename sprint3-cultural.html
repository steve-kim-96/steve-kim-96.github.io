    <h3>What's the difference between EQ and IQ?</h3>
    <p>Let's first discusss what they are. IQ, as we all know, stands for Intelligence Quotient.<br>IQ is a score derived from a set of standardized tests, which is designed to
    assess<br>human intelligence. EQ stands for Emotional Quotient. EQ is the ability of individuals<br>to understand their own emotions, as well as the emotions of those around them.
<br></p>
<p>EQ is important to me because it doesn't just take smarts to get through a job, or even<br>life. If I understand my emotions, why I'm feeling happy, relieved, sad or overwhelmed
<br>Then I can figure out a game plan to tackle whatever is making me feel bad, or celebrate<br> why I'm feeling good. It's also important because if someone around me is feeling
any<br>of those same emotions I can be happy for them or try help them get through whatever<br>it is that's making them feel bad.</p>
<p>This is all relevant to me, because being smart won't help me figure out the emotions of people.<br>If I ever come across an uncomfortable situation at EDA, for example, then
I need to make sure I<br> have a method of working through those emotions.</p>
