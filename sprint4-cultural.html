        <h3>What did I take away from the research?</h3>
        <p>
            I've gained a lot of insights about neuroplasticity and the "Growth Mindset", especially since we've already gone through<br>
            the same material. The one thing that stands out and is a relief to me is the TED Talk given by Dr. Carol Dweck. It was<br>
            about the fact that as long as you believe and know that you can improve and that nothing is impossible is the first<br>
            step taken towards growth. It really gave me a good mindset going forward because there are some challenges that I<br>
            couldn't solve with full confidence in the answer. What kept me going was that through reasoning, and trying to come up<br>
            with a solution, my mind is developing, creating links with what I've learnt through the online courses and videos and<br>
            working out a way to solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, I had a realization of how powerful our minds are, and that attitude is something that can really affect your<br>
            ability to learn. For example, if two people are stuck on the same problem, the person with a growth mindset and positive<br>
            attitude is likely to tackle the problem with good logical reasoning, steps and ways to get around the problem.<br>
            The other person, with a negative view (due to circumstance, life, etc.) is likely to look at the problem, give some options<br>
            that immediately come to mind, and start complaining or give up.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've truly learnt what it means to learn through our struggles and that it's not necessarily the smartest person in the room<br>
            that sees the problem through, but whoever has the right mindset, developed skills as a result, and the determination to<br>
            see it through.
