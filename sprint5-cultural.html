        <h2>Little personal summary</h2>
        <p>
            Sprint 5, at least for me, was such a marathon. There was one day where I felt like I couldn't solve<br>
            the simplest coding problem... I felt like giving up or screaming, then I took a deep breath, told
            myself<br>
            even if it takes all night, I'm going to solve this. Sure enough the issue was a matter of extra
            quotation<br>
            marks LOL! I spent hours going over why my function wasn't working, but the problem was hidden in the<br>
            simplest
            form. I learnt a lot about patience, code, and most importantly, about myself that day.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to share A very simple quote that has shaped my mentality over the years:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <blockquote>"There is no substitute for hard work"</blockquote>
            <figcaption>-Thomas Edison-</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Let's keep working hard, help each other, and build a bright future for each of us.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do I think EDA spends so much time on core when it’s a programming school:</h3>
        <p>
            As it explains from sprint 1, your mentality is key to programming. Programming, from my very little
            experience,<br>
            is such a big thing to tackle and it’s going to take a good long while before we can become proficient.
            Being able<br>
            to stay aware that it’s going to take months, even years to fully grasp everything there is to know about
            how to<br>
            solve programming problems is such a useful mindset to have, because it keeps you patient and willing to
            learn.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the core feel like a waste of time?</h3>
        <p>
            At first, I was skeptical and thought it was going to be a waste of time. But as time went on and as I spent
            more<br>
            and more time evaluating these personal questions and practicing mindfulness, I have come to think that it
            is<br>
            just as important as programming, if not more. These core skills can extend outside of programming,<br>
            bettering our lives, and in return improving our programming, so I think that more time could be spent on
            core than<br> currently is recommended.
        </p>
        <h3>Long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
            All I know is that for now I want to enter the tech industry by getting a job, and eventually, somewhere
            down the line, I<br> want to be an entrepreneur. How that’s going to work, what I’m going to do? I have no
            idea.
        </p>
        <h3>My biggest strengths and limitations for bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
            Biggest strength is determination. If I’m stuck I won’t know how to give up until I’ve solved the
            problem.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Biggest limitation would be tunnel vision. I have a habit of falling into a specific line of thought.
            Luckily, the core skills have helped that habit.
        </p>
        <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>I need to be patient with others. One of the reasons I didn’t go into teaching is because I don’t like to
            slow down for others. If I go ahead, and<br> they lose pace then I don’t stop. I need to be able to
            empathise, stop, listen, and work together.
        </p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills would I like to develop at EDA?</h3>
        <p>
            Reflection is a big problem because I find it boring. I need to be able to stop, and think and experience
            what I did, how I did it, and what I could do<br> better next time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-awareness is a work in progress but it’s helping me move mountains. I want to develop this skill even
            more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leadership skill is something that I’ve always wanted. When Obama gives his beautiful speeches, I think to
            myself “how can I do that?” What sort of skills<br> did he learn to become a leader?
        </p>
        <h3>What are my expectations of myself at bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
            Not waste a minute of it. If I’m stuck, I need to use the problem-solving skills to get through it
            efficiently. If I’m ahead I need to take more time to reflect, and think<br> about how I can do better next
            time. What extra things could I learn?
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ll seek help in a timely way by asking members of my cohort, and the tech facilitator and, most
            importantly, Googling
        </p>
        <h3>Three things Learnt about myself:</h3>
        <p>
            Through completing the core and programming exercises have taught me that I need to let go of the “I should
            know this” mentality. What I mean by this is, even the<br> simplest things can stump you. And different
            things
            stump different people. No matter how simple the exercise may be, be patient, let go of the mentality, and
            try to<br> learn as much as you can while you’re stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing I re-learnt about myself is how stubborn I am. I simply can’t let things go. Especially
            through the programming exercises, I’ve learnt that if I get stumped,<br> I can’t rest until I get the
            answer. I
            think it was both good and bad. Good in the way that I find the way to solve the problem through patience
            and determination. Bad<br> because the problem consumes my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, I love to learn. I think I knew it deep down but I like learning. The more challenging, the better.
            I’m not afraid to ask for help, and I’m not embarrassed by the things<br> I don’t know. I go by the
            mentality
            “babies aren’t embarrassed by the fact that they can’t walk. And once they learn, it’s not too long before
            they start running”.
        </p>
        <h3>Role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h3>
        <p>
            Your values shape the way you think about things. I think that’s why it’s so important and so good that we
            talk about our values at EDA. Ultimately, how we tackle the<br> problems, and the mindset that we hold comes
            from our values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Empathy determines the willingness to see outside of yourself. If someone is struggling with something,
            you don’t look down on them, but you can figure out why<br> it’s difficult, how that person is seeing a
            particular problem, and ultimately helping each other solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-awareness ties everything together. You need to be aware of your condition, your mentality so that
            you are working in an optimal headspace. If you’re stuck and you<br> have tunnel vision because of the
            length
            you’ve been stuck, you need to be able to realise it, take your mind off of the problem, and come back to it
            with a clear and<br> optimistic mind.
        </p>
        <h3>What surprised me the most about core learning</h3>
        <p>
            That it actually matters. I was one of those people that kind of thought “huh, is this actually going to
            help me?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Man, was I wrong to doubt? Especially the self-awareness exercises, whenever I got stumped or on the verge
            of super annoyance, I was able to quickly escape from<br> the situation, recoup, and come back and
            eventually
            solve the problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most challenging aspects of core learning, especially in the beginning, was trying to answer those
            questions about myself. I’d never really asked what kind of person<br> I am, what my values are, what my
            mentality is when I get stuck, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ll manage workload in the program by having a look at what’s expected each week and putting in a plan on
            how I will carry out those tasks, if more time is alotted to one task,<br> how I’ll manage the others.
            Ultimately, I won’t put a time limit. I’ll work no matter how long it takes to finish. I’ll work with others
            by talking through the problem, whether its theirs<br> or mine, and seeing what we can do to solve it. Same goes
            for facilitators and any other stakeholder I’ll be working with.
