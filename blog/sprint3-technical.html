      <h3>Difference between HTML and CSS?</h3>
      <p>Think about the human anatomy. Our skeleton gives us our shape. Without our skeleton, all we are is<br> mush: <br> 
        <img class="harry" src="../images/harryarm.jpg" alt="harry's arm"></p>
      <p>CSS on the other hand gives HTML its features. Without any features we would just be walking<br>
      skeletons... Harry (above) wouldn't have any features, any eyeballs... nothing.</p>
      <p>So that's the difference. But of course, without one, you can't have the other. No one wants<br>to look at a plain
      white page on the internet with some words packed onto it.</p>
      <h3>Difference between accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h3>
      <p>In plain english, the two might seem the same. After all, they both hold data in a list like fashion. <br>
      Here's how they differ. If you want to access information from an array, the first item starts at the<br>
    zeroeth index, which means that item 1 is list item 0. Let's say we have a shopping list. To access<br>the first item on
  the shopping list, you would type shoppingList[0].</p>
  <p>For an object such as "Toy", it might hold a list of features for the toy, e.g. arms, legs, eyes, etc.
    <br>Each feature, for example, "arm" might hold a value representing the number of arms the toy<br> 
    has, for example 8. In order for us to access the toy's arm feature to figure out how many arms<br>
    the toy has, we would use the command "toy.arms" and this would print 8.
  </p> 
  <h3>What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
  <p>In the simplest term, they repeat actions for you. For example, If you want to add two numbers<br>
    together you just add them, like 5 + 3. What if you needed to add 5 pairs of numbers?<br>
  20 pairs? 100 pairs? This is where functions come in. For this example we can define a certain<br>
number, "a" and the other number "b". All you need to do is tell the function to add<br> a and btogether!</p>

      <h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>Control flow is just a matter of conditions. Let's think about laundry, or any<br> daily task you carry<br>out.
      The first condition you want to check is "Do I have dirty clothes".<br>If the answer is yes (or "true" in programming)
    then you need to do laundry.<br> Or else, you don't.</p>
    <p>Another condition you might want to check is "is the weather sunny".If that question<br> evaluates<br>to true then
    you can hang the washing outside, or else you hang it inside.</p>
    <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
    <p>The DOM is an acronym, which stands for <strong>D</strong>ocument <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>M</strong>odel.
    In order for us<br> to manipulate the<br> HTML in terms of giving it design using CSS, or giving it functionality using 
    JavaScript<br>, we need access to each part of the HTML. We want access to each header,<br> paragraph, image, and so on.<br>
  The DOM was created so that we could do that. The way to picture the DOM is like 
  <br>a tree:
<br><img class="dom" src="../images/DOM.png" alt="picture of the DOM"></p>
<p>How this helps us is by typing in certain commands, we can gain access to each part of the<br> document, giving us
a lot of flexibility and enabling us to design each intricate part of the<br> web page. An example of 
how we might interact with the DOM in terms of CSS is by typing<br> "p" to gain access to all paragraphs in the document
and making its "color" <strong class=red-text>red</strong>.</p>
