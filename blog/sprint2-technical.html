      <p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the difference between Margin, Padding, and Border?</p>

      <img src="../images/margin.jpg" class="margin-pic">
      <p class="answer"><strong>Answer</strong>: This picture shows the content in the middle, which can the word,
        sentence,<br>
        picture, or whatever product you want. The content is always enclosed in an invisible box<br> (unless styled to
        be shown). The "padding" is the space between the border/line
        of that<br> invisible box. The "margin" is the space outside of that border.</p>

      <p class="analogy"><strong>Analogy</strong>: Think of an egg. An egg's content is the egg itself. The border of
        the egg is the eggshell.<br> The padding would be described as the
        space between the egg and the shell (inside of the eggshell)<br> and the margin would be the space between the
        outer eggshell and the things
        around it (egg carton,<br> human hands, etc.)

      <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
      <p>It's much simpler than you think. Don't worry about other devices for now.<br> Let's get on with the basics. In CSS the commands for "Margin", "Padding"<br> and "Border" are Margin,
      Padding and Border.</p>
      <p>If you have a look at this code snippet here:</p>
      <img src="../images/code-snippet.PNG" alt="code snippet">
      <p>You can see these commands. the size 10 represents the top and as the numbers regress, you would<br> move clockwise along the box i.e. 10 is top, 9 is right, 8 is bottom
        and 7 is left.<br>the px  you see beside the numbers represent "pixels" which is a unit of measure.<br> The border command however doesn't change spacing, but the thickness of the<br>
        border:
