        <h3>The time I got blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
        <p>
            During the time I was working on the kata, I came across a lot of problems. I've come to realize that some of them<br>
            were small problems. The one mentionable problem was during an exercise where I needed to create a collection of 
        </p>
        <p>
            elements called an object. All I had to do was use two little symbols "{}" which indicates the creation of an object<br>
            and then place my elements in them e.g. name, age, and so on. I thought about it for a while, even going through<br>
            previous exercises and I Googled "How to return an object". When I looked at the solution I couldn't believe that<br>
            I slipped on something so simple... 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>There are many listed ways of problem solving:</strong><br>
            Pseudocode, trying something, Rubber Ducky Method, Reading error messages, Console.logging, Googling,<br>
            Asking peers, Asking coaches, Improving by reflecting, and so on. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still working through the error message method but at the very least I can decipher where my problem<br>
            is, and for the most part, what's missing. The only problem I have with asking peers or coaches is sometimes<br>
            they aren't available and not everyone is in the position to help. I'm a bit of a weirdo so talking to myself or
            at<br> the wall/inanimate object has always been a problem solving method for everything. The most fun is just<br> trying
            things and seeing what they do and seeing how I can use them to solve my problem.

        <h3>The time I solved a problem in an elegant way:</h3>
        <p>
            I solved a problem that involved taking a statement that was written backwards, and putting it the right<br>way.
        The smoothness of thought when solving this problem was just such a big moment for me. I'm not<br> saying I'm good at 
    coding. Nowhere near, but my thought process was extremely clear solving this one.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, I remembered that there was a method that allowed me to seperate a statement into a list of<br>
            individual words called the <strong>.split</strong> method. I then thought, how can I reverse the order and, at the same<br>
            time reverse the words themselves. Turns out there's a method called the <strong>.reverse</strong> method. And then<br> 
            straight away,
            I remembered that in a previous exercise I practiced putting words and statements<br> together using the 
            <strong>.join</strong> method. 
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully comes a time where I have enough experience that moments of clicking together like this<br>
        happens more often but that was an elegant and smooth way of solving that particular problem.</p>
