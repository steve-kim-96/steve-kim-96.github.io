            <p><strong>A difficult ethical decision to make...</strong></p>
            <p>An ethical decision I had to make was when I was working at a call centre for an airline. As you'd know from the past year,<br> it has been very troubling
              for travellers around the world and it was a situation where the traveller needed to re-enter<br> New Zealand as soon as possible. Airlines were scrambling to create
              company policies to best assist travellers but due<br> to delays I had to stick to the current airline policy for ticket changes and purchases. It was a matter of ethics
              for me,<br> even though I didn't have any power to go against the organization. I chose the current policy and the consequence of<br> that was the traveller had to pay
              for their own flight expenditure without any sort of subsidy. Luckily we were allowed to<br> apply policies retrospectively so eventually the issue was solved, but I sadly
              had to be the bad person...
