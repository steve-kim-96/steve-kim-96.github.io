    <p><strong>A difficult ethical decision to make...</strong><br><br>An ethical decision I had to make was when I was
      working at a call centre for an airline. As you'd know<br> from the past year, it has been very troubling
      for travellers around the world and it was a situation where<br> the traveller needed to re-enter New Zealand as
      soon as possible. Airlines were scrambling to create
      company<br> policies to best assist travellers but due to delays I had to stick to the current airline policy for
      ticket changes and<br> purchases. It was a matter of ethics
      for me, even though I didn't have any power to go against the organization.<br> I chose the current policy and the
      consequence of that was the traveller had to pay
      for their own flight expenditure<br> without any sort of subsidy. Luckily we were allowed to apply policies
      retrospectively so eventually the issue was<br> solved, but I sadly chose the other path...

      <p><strong>How has my culture influenced my values and identity?</strong><br><br>
        I am lucky enough to have grown up with two cultures at the same time. On one part, my family<br> is from South Korea but I was born in the beautiful land of
      the long white cloud.The South Korean<br> values of hard work and determination has allowed me to focus in on the tasks I've carried out<br> throughout my life. The 
    New Zealand values of kindness, acceptance, and willpower have allowed<br> me to tackle many difficult situations in my life, giving me experiences I never would have had<br>otherwise.</p>

    <p><strong>Peronality Assessment:<br><br> <img src="images/personality.png" alt="" class="personality"></strong></p>
    
    <section class="right-col-p-2">
      <p>Based on this assessment and my own evaluation, my strengths are determination, energy, and assertiveness.<br> INTP stands for Introvert, iNtuitive, Thinking, Perceiving and 
        represents individual's preferences in four<br> dimensions characterising personality type, according to Jung's and Briggs Myers' theories of personality type.</p><br>
      <p><strong>In terms of career development</strong>, they will enable to work hard, stay focused for a long time and also go for<br> what I think is worth my time.</p><br>
      <p><strong>In terms of my learning journey</strong> my strengths will help me push through the difficult parts of this course<br> with determination and energy. It will 
      be pretty interesting to see how my values and personality will<br> intersect with the obstacles of this course, but my guess is that I will push through those obstacles
    with<br> brute force.</p><br> 
    <p>The times I'm reminded of where I tried to work productively and cooperatively with teammates but was<br> faced with tension, was during university. I overcame it the only
    way I knew how, with brute force.<br>I ended up completing the assignment on my own, with very minimal contact with the team, other then<br>to get their signatures.</p>
